### Q) How is the Java code that you write executed on the machine/CPU?*
# Java Code Execution Process

This section provides an overview of how Java code is translated into machine-executable code on the CPU, detailing each step in the process.

## 1. Java Code to Bytecode
   - **Java Compiler (`javac`)**:  
     The Java code you write in human-readable format (in `.java` files) is first compiled by the Java compiler, invoked using the command `javac`. The compiler converts the source code into platform-independent bytecode, which is stored in `.class` files.
   - **Compilation Process**:  
     The `javac` compiler analyzes the Java source code and translates it into bytecode instructions. Each `.java` file corresponds to a `.class` file containing the bytecode.

## 2. Bytecode to Machine Code
   - **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**:  
     The JVM is responsible for executing the compiled bytecode. It translates the bytecode into native machine code that the underlying hardware (CPU) can execute.
   
   ### Key Components of JVM Execution:
   - **Interpreter**:  
     Initially, the JVM uses an interpreter to execute bytecode. The interpreter processes each bytecode instruction one by one, allowing the program to start running quickly, albeit at a slower speed.
   
   - **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler**:  
     To improve performance, the JVM uses the JIT compiler to optimize frequently executed bytecode sections (known as "hot spots"). These sections are compiled into native machine code for more efficient execution. 
   
   - **Optimized Native Code Execution**:  
     Once the bytecode is converted into native machine code by the JIT compiler, the JVM directly executes the optimized native code on the CPU, similar to how native applications run on a machine.

## Summary
- The Java compiler (`javac`) translates the source code into platform-independent bytecode.
- The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) interprets and/or compiles the bytecode into native machine code.
- The JVM uses a combination of an interpreter and Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for optimal performance, ensuring the bytecode is efficiently executed on the CPU.
